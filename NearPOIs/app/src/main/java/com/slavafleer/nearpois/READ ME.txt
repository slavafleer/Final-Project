Near POIs

Final Project at John Bryce

Created by Slava Fleer


The main idea of the project is to find and show list of POIs (Points Of Interest)
to user by his location (device location).

User can enter by text or default buttons a specific type of POIs, as Cafe, Parks and others.

The first screen on phone or left/upper part of tablet would care for searching and
showing list of pois to user, the second screen(activity) on phone or right/bottom part of tablet
screen would show the map of chosen poi from the list.

****Delete if would not be completed*****
As option would be added a way to this poi and arriving time.

In Setting choosing from big list which defaults buttons would be in quick search bar.
